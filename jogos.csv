You can see a beautifully designed sea battle, familiar to those from your school times. You have to play against the computer and you need to destroy all enemy ships before yours are destroyed. Features: Very beautiful graphics Classic game You can compete with your friends Supporting all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, SteamOS) A lot of Steam achievements The gameplay is very simple. When you are preparing for the match, there are some ships of different sizes - from simple battle boat to a huge battleship. You put them on the battlefield and nobody else than you knows their location. Of course, don't know the enemy's positions neither. Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety, so that the battle is always different. The game perfectly develops strategic thinking and will be useful to both adults and children. In addition, it will help you to plunge into nostalgia for simple classic games.","['English']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/825930/header.jpg?t=1657805439","","","mail@educational-games.ru",True,True,True,0,"",0,36,11,"",19,0,"",11,0,11,0,"Educational Games","Educational Games","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Leaderboards","Casual,Indie","Indie,Casual","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/825930/ss_451102c3f19133ea475c220bd09717073fe5a169.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657805439,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/825930/ss_ea796c43bae36ad059e47b03eabf64ca65ead330.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657805439,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/825930/ss_53d81354badcb7486ae96388dec5e58534bf5b3f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657805439,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/825930/ss_a74063c470a0fb3c731673dbbc0c3dcfc69ccabf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657805439,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/825930/ss_076ea9deb1d0d2f24860349c8682539d2742bde5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657805439","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256712096/movie_max.mp4?t=1521724364"

The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/header.jpg?t=1657631096","http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw9/?lang=us","http://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/support/","support@koeitecmo.co.uk",True,False,False,0,"",0,3075,6009,"",44,5946,"",215,15,76,15,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together","Action","Action,Hack and Slash,Open World,Historical,Musou,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Anime,Co-op,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,RPG,Adventure,Beat 'em up,Online Co-Op,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_6a9749773b19bfc532f8a716004f3d333fb4b868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_bc3f18711562cbdb594526f7b1ecfad88b8fa838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_1071b4f997bb7ddd97283fc3dc05ec145f08c11c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_750a13c069c1c0d9a5f41a447b6622d2057030d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_00cd4e157cd424983b23a0d48640aea9f3fac779.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_c198c86da8f96a5980b9bbf215045f8f41b28ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768983/movie_max.mp4?t=1576123907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708706/movie_max.mp4?t=1518509272"
